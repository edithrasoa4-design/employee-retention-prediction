📊 Employee Retention Prediction | HR Analytics Project

A data-driven analysis and machine learning project to identify the key factors influencing employee turnover and predict employee retention using Logistic Regression.

🔍 Project Overview

Employee turnover is a major challenge for organizations.
This project analyzes HR data to:

Identify key factors driving employee attrition

Visualize trends in salary and department retention

Build a predictive model to estimate employee exit probability

The goal is to support data-driven HR decision-making.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes employee information such as:

Satisfaction Level

Last Evaluation Score

Number of Projects

Average Monthly Hours

Time Spent at Company

Promotion History

Department

Salary Level

Employee Status (left: 0 = stayed, 1 = left)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Findings:

🔴 Low satisfaction level strongly correlates with employee exit

💰 Employees with low salary show significantly higher turnover

🏢 Certain departments have higher attrition rates

⏳ Employees with longer tenure show varying exit patterns

Data visualizations used:

Correlation heatmap

Salary vs Retention bar charts

Department vs Retention bar charts

Boxplots for satisfaction and working hours
